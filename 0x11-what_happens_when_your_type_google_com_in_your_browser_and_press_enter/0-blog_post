What happens when we click https://www.google.com

In the digital age, the simple act of typing "www.google.com" into a browser initiates a complex 
process across various systems and protocols. Let's delve into the intricacies of this process,
unraveling the layers of technology that enable seamless web browsing.

1. DNS (Domain Name System):
The Domain Name System acts as the internet's address book, translating human-readable domain names like
"google.com" into machine-readable IP addresses. This crucial step ensures that users can easily access websites
without needing to remember lengthy strings of numbers.

How DNS Works:
When users enter "www.google.com" into their browser, DNS servers are queried to obtain the corresponding IP address.
This involves a series of level lookups, starting from the browser(client) cache to root DNS servers and finally to the authoritative
servers for the domain.

2. Firewall:
Firewalls serve as the guardians of network security, filtering incoming traffic to prevent unauthorized access and
bounce-off malicious attacks. By enforcing rules based on port numbers and packet inspection, firewalls safeguard the integrity
of servers and data.

3. HTTPS/SSL (Secure Socket Layer):
HTTPS and SSL encryption play vital roles in ensuring secure communication between
clients and servers. By encrypting data transmission and verifying the authenticity of websites through SSL certificates, HTTPS
mitigates the risk of interception and tampering of data.

4. Load Balancer:
As websites attract varying levels of traffic, load balancers distribute incoming requests across multiple servers to optimize performance
and reliability. Through intelligent algorithms and dynamic routing, load balancers ensure efficient resource utilization and seamless user 
experiences, even during peak traffic periods.

5. Web Server:
At the heart of web infrastructure, web servers fulfill requests for web content, serving HTML documents, CSS stylesheets, and other resources
to clients' browsers. By processing requests and generating responses in real time, web servers lay the foundation for interactive and dynamic 
web experiences.

6. Application Server:
For applications requiring computational tasks or database interactions, application servers serve as the backbone of functionality.
Whether it's processing e-commerce transactions or retrieving user data from databases, application servers execute business logic and
deliver dynamic content to clients.

7. Database:
Behind the scenes, databases store and manage vast amounts of structured data, supporting critical functions such as user authentication
and content delivery. By efficiently retrieving and updating records, databases enable web applications to deliver personalized experiences
and drive user engagement.

In conclusion, the process of a client sending a request to " www.google.com" is a process and protocol that
underpins the modern web. From DNS resolution to SSL encryption, each component plays a vital role in delivering seamless and secure browsing
experiences for users worldwide.
